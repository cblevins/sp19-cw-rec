**Office Hours**<br>
Office hours are held each Wednesday from 9:30-11:30am. Take advantage of office hours as an opportunity to talk about any aspect of the class: the week’s reading, ideas and strategies for upcoming assignments, feedback you have received, or difficult themes and concepts. If weekly office hours conflict with your schedule, please contact me to schedule a different time to meet. I look forward to getting to know each of you! My office is located in Room 237 in [Meserve Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Meserve+Hall/@42.3378125,-71.0931276,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e37a22217737a9:0x8ba53f8873603d10!8m2!3d42.3378086!4d-71.0909389). 

**Required Readings**<br>
There is no textbook for this course. In keeping with one of its central learning objectives, you will instead be "reading" history across a variety of mediums (podcasts, films, etc.) Most of these are freely available to listen, watch, or download, but students will need to purchase one book: Ari Kelman and Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, *Battle Lines: A Graphic History of the Civil War* (Hill and Wang: 2015).

**Attendance and Absences**<br>
Attendance at each class is mandatory. **Two absences** are allowed per semester, after which additional absences will impact your participation grade. All absences must be made-up with a 500-word response to the day or week’s readings that selects two of the major themes to analyze/critique/elaborate on, due within one week of the absence. Being on time is also part of attendance – if you are **late to class more than once**, your will start to lose points from your participation grade. If you are facing health and wellness, financial, or other issues, I encourage you to contact me directly and to reach out to We Care (<https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/we-care/>). 

**Classroom Behavior**<br>
You are required to be respectful to your fellow classmates and professor: listening attentively, not interrupting, and maintaining a civil discourse. Bullying or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Learn names and always assume the best intentions in each other. If you have any issues, please talk to me directly so that I can address them. You are also welcome to eat food or drinks in class, provided they are not distracting.

**Technology**<br>
You are welcome to bring a laptop to take notes during class, but please put away your mobile phones during class *unless* I ask you to take them out for an activity. If you are looking at material that is not related to the topic at hand, you will be asked to leave the classroom and it will count as an unexcused absence. If you are making more eye contact with your screen than your classmates, your participation grade will also suffer.

**Late Assignments**<br>
Late assignments will be penalized by one half letter grade for each day they are late, starting immediately after the specified time (an A paper becomes an A-, an A- to B+, etc.).

**Course Content Note**<br>
This course will involve historical topics that you may find emotionally distressful, including episodes of violence. I have included these topics because they are foundational to understanding the era of Civil War & Reconstruction. If you have concerns about reading and discussing particular topics, please come talk to me at the beginning of the semester. I will work with you to find alternative readings or ways for you to participate on the days in which we discuss those topics.

**Health and Wellness**<br>
Your ability to learn is often shaped by external factors outside of the classroom. Every student should prioritize their physical, emotional, and mental health. Any student who is struggling to do so (lacking a safe and stable place to live, having difficulty affording sufficient food to eat every day, facing financial stresses, etc.) is urged to contact We Care (<https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/we-care/>) or the University Health and Counseling Services staff (<http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/>). If you are comfortable doing so, please contact me directly if you need to discuss any issues that are impacting your ability to learn in this class.

**Reasonable Accommodation**<br>
Students with documented learning disabilities will receive reasonable accommodation in this class. If you have a learning disability, please notify me and also register with [Northeastern’s Disability Resource Center](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/) at 20 Dodge Hall or call 617-373-4428.
 
**Title IX**<br>
Northeastern’s Title IX Policy prohibits discrimination based on gender, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship or domestic violence, and stalking (for more information, see the website for the Office for University Equity and Compliance (<https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/>). The Title IX Policy applies to the entire community, including male, female, transgender students, and faculty and staff. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted,confidential support and guidance can be found through University Health and Counseling Services staff (<http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/>) and the Center for Spiritual Dialogue and Service clergy members (<http://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/>). By law, those employees are not required to report allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the University. Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Gender Equity and Compliance at: titleix@northeastern.edu and/or through NUPD (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency 617.373.2121). Reporting Prohibited Offenses to NUPD does NOT commit the victim/affected party to future legal action.

**Academic Integrity**<br>
All students are responsible for understanding and complying with Northeastern University’s policy on Academic Integrity. Cheating or plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated and will be immediately referred to the Office of Student Council and Conflict Resolution, For more details, see <http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/>.
